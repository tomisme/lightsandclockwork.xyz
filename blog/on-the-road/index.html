<p>We‚Äôre on the road at last!</p>



<p>After staying a few days with family in Jindalee, we struck out north-east to a rest stop in Wannamal for a two-night stop. Passing through the Bindoon highlands was definitely a highlight of that ninety minute drive, with golden, rolling hills stretching far, adorned with gnarled grass trees.</p>

<p>We parked Robin (our van) in a spot where we‚Äôd have a nice, shady view of the surrounding bushland from the side door. It was a well-kept rest stop on the site of the Wheatbelt town‚Äôs old primary school, with very clean toilets and running (non-potable) water. We were sharing it with about six other self-contained vehicles, with plenty of space to spread out.</p>

<p>On our second day I worked on a writing project for a client, while Tom pottered about. There are a few non-essential things that remain unfinished in Robin, and we intend to do them slowly as we journey around. It‚Äôs nice to feel un-rushed after the van build sprint we forced ourselves into over the last few months. Not the best thing for our mental and physical health, as it happens (duh), but we are now very appreciative of our past-selves‚Äô efforts.</p>

<p>When I‚Äôd submitted my work we headed across the road from the campsite to play a game of twilight tennis at the local courts, apparently named in my honor. The flies were out in full force, and I took the opportunity to impart some old tennis wisdom to Tom from my dad: ‚ÄúIf the flies are bugging you, you‚Äôre not moving enough‚Äù. We had a dinner of teriyaki lentils with steamed potatoes and sauteed sesame vegetables, then settled in for an evening of relaxing and planning our next move.</p>



<p>This morning, after a small breakfast of coffee and bananas, we packed up camp and drove an hour up the road to Jingemia Cave. There, we boiled eggs and ate curried egg sandwiches before heading for a short hike and explore of the mouth of the cave. It was an impressive sight: red dirt and huge boulders, and what looked like welcome swallows swooping in and out of the crevices where their nests were ensconced. We climbed to the bottom, peering up at the sheer drop from the cliffs above, and speculating as to the owners of the different sized animal droppings we encountered among the rocks.</p>

<p>Ascending to the cliff edge, we hiked the short distance around the perimeter of the cave opening, marveling at an expansive panoramic view of the land on one side, before heading back to Robin.</p>

<p>One more hour of driving and we‚Äôll be at our next stop: Three Springs.</p>
